# Computing S points in N dimensions
This is a simple project of mine that i took
an exercise to practice python that was to
compute the euclidian distance formula.

I did it, but i saw potential to make it harder
and so i did, i thought, why stop at 2D, when there's more
and so i did more, for 3D, and for more than just 2 points,
i could calculate the relative distances between 3 points
calculating the distance between the 1 and 2, 2 and 3,
and 1 and 3.

But... we can compute as many dimensions as we want, and that's because the
generalized formula for the euclidean distance is a sum, and that
means we can do it as far as we want, and there are no restraints
about the number of points. Using one formula of graph theory,
some for loops, i did it in the most ineficiant way, but i did it.

This is the code, and i'm happy i did it, i learned a lot about
python and lists, and i can say it was fun, i hope to optmize it
and maybe write in in PHP or C# that are things that i'm learning
but for now i have this code and wanted for it to be public.

## Some small note

I also did some research and found that these calculations are used
in machine learning and hipotetical euclidian espaces can have points that
can represent a lot of things, and their distance apart can measure how equal they are,
and a lot about all of that, and diferent metrics and others...
